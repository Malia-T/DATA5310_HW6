  <p>In this assignment, I modified the scatter plot with Age of Building and Number of Available Parking Spots from the composite plot in HW4. The final result is a brushed and linked graphic, with brushing available for a histogram of Stability Index. Since the Stability Index was a large focus for me in HW4, I decided to integrate this aspect into the scatter plot through brushing and linking. The goal was to highlight how Stability of a cultural space may be related to its "sprawl" (parking spots) and/or the age of the building. I used point geometry and position encodings for Age of Building on the x-axis and Available Parking on the y-axis; location is the most effective way of encoding quantitative variables. I also used tooltips to convey other information to the user--the Name of the cultural space, its Neighborhoood location, and the Stability Index. I used log scaling on the y-axis to better showcase the points. The interaction enhances the plot because it displays a continuous flow of data as the brushed "area" is moved around the histogram. The slow transitions as the brush area is moved around aids in understanding the relationship. In this way, it is apparent that more stable cultural spaces tend to have more parking spots available. The original plot had points from the neighborhood of Capitol Hill highlighted in red; using tooltips shows more rich data about neighborhoods. This way, the user can investigate points of interest after brushing and viewing the relationship.</p>
